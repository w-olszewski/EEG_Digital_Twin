# EEG_Digital_Twin
Personalized EEG Digital Twin tool. 

This algorithm utilized The Virtual Brain (TVB) tool in an attemt to create a personalized EEG-based simulation of brain activity. 

The algorithym takes an EEG recording as input, and by global parameter search, it adjusts the TVB model in order to produce an EEG trace as similar to the empirical data as possible.
